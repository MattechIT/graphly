# Graphly
An interactive graph editor and visualizer designed to build, manipulate, and solve complex algorithms in real-time.

## 🚀 Overview
Graphly is a web-based tool that allows users to create custom graphs through an intuitive interface. Beyond simple drawing, it serves as a powerful algorithmic solver, providing a visual step-by-step breakdown of how data moves through a network.

## ✨ Key Features
Interactive Sandbox: Add nodes with a click, link them with edges, and reorganize your layout using smooth drag-and-drop.

Pathfinding Algorithms: Full implementation of Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms for shortest-path problems.

Network Flow: Resolve max-flow challenges using the Ford-Fulkerson method.

Step-by-Step Visualization: Watch the algorithms "think" as they traverse nodes and relax edges—perfect for educational purposes.

Lightweight & Fast: Built with pure JavaScript and SVG for high performance without bulky dependencies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project focuses on modern web standards and performance:

HTML5 & CSS3: Responsive design and sleek UI.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Ensures crisp rendering of nodes and edges at any zoom level.

Vanilla JavaScript: Core logic and algorithm engine handled without external frameworks for maximum speed.
